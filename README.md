# General Info
A project from The Odin Project course with the goal of copying a design of a Lading Page.

# Technologies
The website was made using only plain HTML and CSS with Flexbox.

# Self-Reflection
It was really hard to do even doing the layout exercises and it didn't became so responsive but I think it's fine cause they say we will discover how to do it in the future but yet I think I should have used more flex items.

# Next Features
When I learn more about HTML and CSS I will come back and refactor it, gonna make it have a unique style like a site about pet rats and make it reponsible too. Maybe add JavaScript events too.
